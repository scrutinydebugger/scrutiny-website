                                When come to debugging an embedded application, getting a working debugging environment is often painful. 
                                Most commonly, JTAG are proprietary and costly or free and hard to use (or even simply bad). If we make abstraction of the cost, 
                                professional JTAG software can be very complex and tedious to automate.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These problems often lead hobbyists or smaller company developers to aim for a working 
                                console output and do most of their work using dumb "printf" debug. 
                                Scrutiny is a reasonable alternative for efficient debugging and tuning of an embedded application.
                            </p>

                            <div class="text-center">
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="images/complexity-vs-capabilities.png" alt="Complexity vs capabilities" style="max-height:480px">
                            </div>

                            <p>
                                Also, some applications are critical and cannot be stopped or even access through JTAG while in operation such as a drone controller. 
                                As it is flying, the debugging process would need to not interfere with the application as it could lead to physical damages of the 
                                hardware and obviously, hooking a wired JTAG is hardly an option during flight.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                So how do we handle that? Scrutiny does not interfere with the original application, because it works through instrumentation. Breakpoints are 
                                not possible, and memory accesses are done synchronously within the embedded application. The developer controls when Scrutiny instrumentation is executed,
                                and chooses its execution priority. Memory regions can be marked as forbidden or read-only, to avoid tampering with any critical memory section.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Finally, Scrutiny works through the communication channel already available on your hardware. So if you have Wifi, or wireless 
                                serial port, then Scrutiny will be able to use that channel to talk to its debug server. No need for additional proprietary hardware.

                            Consider the following C++ code.
                            <pre>
                                <code class="language-c++">

                            <p>
                                It may appear that calling <code class="language-c++">some_function()</code> will never print anything, right? Unless of course, the device memory is being tampered with... 
                                That's exactly what Scrutiny will do. Here's what this will look like in the GUI

                                In the demo above, we see that the variables have been auto-discovered using the application debug symbol. Writing <code class="language-c++">must_print</code> made the counter go up and printed to the console.

                                For this demonstration, a dummy binary that connect the Scrutiny Lib to the server with a UDP socket has been used.

                                How did Scrutiny found the variables of our example above? As mentioned, it uses the compiler debugging symbols, meaning that the build toolchain
                                must be altered a bit to add the Scrutiny stage after linking.
                                <br />
                                Note that an application must be compiled with the debugging symbols (generally, the with the -g option). 
                                Once the Scrutiny toolchain has produced its artifacts,  the debugging symbols can be dropped from the final 
                                binary with a command such as <code class="bash">objcopy --strip-debug firmware.elf</code>

                                The unique identifier will be used to load a Scrutiny Firmware Description (SFD) file from a local database.

                                Scrutiny has the ability to make a graph of the variables/<abbr title="Runtime Published Values">RPV</abbr>/Aliases exposed by the server. <br/>
                                Two types of graphs are possibles

                                            This graph is made by the client. Each time a value update is broadcasted by the server, the sample will be logged. The update
                                            rate of the server is defined by the device communication link bandwidth. The faster the link, the faster the server can poll the device for 
                                            memory dump and the faster the values are updated.

                                        This type of graph can make long acquisition (minutes, hours, even days). However, the sampling rate is dictated by the bandwidth of 
                                        the device communication link, meaning that it won't be stable and decrease with number of element being watched. Fast event can be missed. 
                                        </p>

                                            The embedded graph works differently. As the name suggest, the embedded device will take care of logging the variables. This feature is 
                                            specially useful to catch a fast event or follow the evolution of internal state variable, like a state machine

                                        <p>
                                            A buffer dedicated to datalogging must be given to scrutiny-embedded. When a graph request is received, the device will start filling this
                                            buffer like a circular one until the graph trigger condition is met. It will then continue to log until the event is a the requested position 
                                            in the buffer, allowing to see before or after the event.

                                            Unlike the client graph, the communication device link is not a limitation for the embedded graph, but the size of the buffer is. 
                                            The sampling rate will be steady and reliable (unless your firmware task is jittery), but the length of the acquisition will depend
                                            on the amount of memory allocated to datalogging and also the number of signal being logged.
