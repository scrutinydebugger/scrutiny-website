                                When it comes to debugging an embedded application, establishing a functional debugging environment can be challenging. 
                                More often than not, JTAG tools are either proprietary and expensive, or free but difficult to use, and sometimes even ineffective. 
                                Ignoring the cost factor, professional JTAG software can be overly complex and cumbersome to automate.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These issues frequently lead developers from smaller companies or hobbyists to rely on a working console output and resort to basic ‘printf’ debugging. 
                                Scrutiny presents a viable alternative for efficient debugging and tuning of an embedded application.
                            </p>

                            <div class="text-center">
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="images/complexity-vs-capabilities.png" alt="Complexity vs capabilities" style="max-height:480px">

                            <p>
                                Certain applications, such as a drone controller, are critical and cannot be halted or accessed via JTAG while in operation. 
                                As the drone is in flight, the debugging process must not interfere with the application to prevent potential hardware damage. 
                                Obviously, connecting a wired JTAG is hardly feasible during flight.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So how do we handle this? Scrutiny does not interfere with the original application, because it works through instrumentation. Breakpoints are 
                                not possible, and memory accesses occur synchronously within the embedded application. The developer dictates when Scrutiny instrumentation's is executed,
                                and sets its execution priority. Memory regions can be marked as forbidden or read-only, to avoid tampering with any critical memory section.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lastly, Scrutiny operates through the communication channel already present on your hardware. Therefore, if you have Wifi, or a wireless 
                                serial port, Scrutiny can utilize that channel to communicate with its debug server. There's no need for additional proprietary hardware.

                            Consider the following C++ code.
                            <pre>
                                <code class="language-c++">

                            <p>
                                It may seem that invoking <code class="language-c++">some_function()</code> will never print anything, right? Unless, of course, the device memory is being tampered with... 
                                That's exactly what Scrutiny will do. Here's what this will look like in the GUI

                                In the demo above, we see that the variables have been auto-discovered using the application debug symbol. Writing <code class="language-c++">must_print</code> made the counter go up and printed to the console.
                                <br />
                                For this demonstration, a dummy binary that connect the Scrutiny Lib to the server with a UDP socket has been used.

                                            Aliases are useful to maintain a consistent interface across different firmware versions of a same firmware when a user

                                            For automatic testing, aliases are essentials.

                                How did Scrutiny found the variables in our previous above? As mentioned, it utilizes the debugging symbols from the compiler, 
                                which means the build toolchain needs to be slightly modified to include the Scrutiny stage after linking.
                                <br />
                                Note that an application must be compiled with debugging symbols (generally, the with the -g option). 
                                Once the Scrutiny toolchain has produced its artifacts, the debugging symbols can be removed from the final 
                                binary with a command such as <code class="bash">objcopy --strip-debug firmware.elf</code>

                                along with its configuration.
                                The unique identifier is used to load a Scrutiny Firmware Description (SFD) file from a database local to the server. 
                                The configuration provides the server with information about the device's capabilities such as: Protocol version, buffer sizes, maximum bandwidth, enabled features, etc.

                                Scrutiny has the ability to make a graph of the variables/<abbr title="Runtime Published Values">RPV</abbr>/Aliases exposed by the server. <br/>

                                            This graph is generated by the client. Each time the server broadcasts a value update, the sample is logged. The update
                                            rate of the server is determined by the bandwidth of the device communication link. The faster the link, the quicker the 
                                            server can poll the device for a memory dump and the quicker the values are updated.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            This type of graph can capture long acquisitions (ranging from minutes to hours, and even days). 
                                            However, the sampling rate is dictated by the bandwidth of  the device communication link, meaning that it won't be stable and 
                                            decrease with the number of element being watched. Fast event may be missed.

                                            The embedded graph works differently. As the name suggests, the embedded device will take care of logging the variables. This feature is 
                                            especially useful to catch a fast event or follow the evolution of internal state variable, like a state machine

                                            A buffer dedicated to datalogging must be given to scrutiny-embedded. When a graph request is received, the device will start filling this
                                            buffer like a circular one until the graph trigger condition is met. It will then continue to log until the event is at the requested position 
                                            in the buffer, allowing to see before or after the event.

                                            Unlike the client graph, the communication device link is not a limitation for the embedded graph, but the size of the buffer is. 
                                            The sampling rate will be steady and reliable (unless your firmware task is jittery), but the length of the acquisition will depend
                                            on the amount of memory allocated to datalogging and also the number of signal being logged.
