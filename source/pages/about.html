                                Scrutiny Debugger is an open source project published under <a href="https://mit-license.org/">MIT license</a> (no restrictions) on Github. 
                                Is has been originally developed in Montreal, Canada. 
                                Its development has started in 2021 and is, up to now, developed on a voluntary basis during the developers personal free time.

                                The motivation for this project came from the fact that no adequate open-source calibration tools seemed available back in 2021, and it 
                                still seems to be the case at the moment of the first release (2023). The capabilities of Scrutiny is a happy mix of the best feature that the 
                                authors experienced with various paid software used in the automotive industry. We have many additional features in our wishlist, but can only
                                implement those that our free time allows.

                                The IT infrastructure (website, <abbr title="Continuous Integration">CI</abbr> server/agents, domains) is funded by the developers personal money.
