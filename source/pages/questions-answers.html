                                Somewhere in between.
                            </p>

                                Most developers know what a debugger is. Breakpoints, stepping and watching variables. A calibration tool is a term far less popular
                                than a debugger. It doesn't have the same purpose although some functionalities can overlap.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The term calibration tool is mainly known by the aerospace and automotive/racing industry. It's a software meant to send configurations to a 
                                device and monitor its behavior with the freshly given parameters. The most common example would be a 
                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller">PID controller</a> tuning. The P,I and D gains are tunable values. A developer will test the system 
                                response in a situation with some given gains, check how the variables evolve over time and then adjust these gains again. It's a high level debugging process.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These tunable parameters are often identified by a unique ID that the calibration tool knows about. Writing and reading will be done through a 
                                communication channel (serial port, CAN bus, socket) by sending a read or write command for the given parameter ID. It's pretty much 
                                what Scrutiny does with its RPVs (Runtime Published Values).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What if the tunable parameters are ALL the variables? Instead of exposing them explicitly in the embedded firmware by assigning IDs, 
                                they can be automatically discovered using the debug symbols of a binary. 
                                <br />
                                That's what the aerospace and automotive industry have aimed for using protocols such 
                                as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XCP_(protocol)">XCP</a> and the <a href="https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/mcd-2-mc/">A2L</a> 
                                file format. Such tool can be very handy to monitor the execution of a program and find defects; we're approaching a debugger.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Scrutiny is doing the same, using the debugging symbols to become a calibration tool on steroids. 
                                Although it cannot be used to step or watch locals variables, these limitations can be easily worked around
                                using embedded graphs and making variables temporarily static during the debug phase.

                        <h2 class="article-title">I only see static and global variables. What about locals?</h2>

                            <p>
                                Local variables on the stack cannot be read by Scrutiny. Make them static volatile temporarily, but avoid reentrance.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Because it works through instrumentation, the memory is accessed by Scrutiny only when the Scrutiny
                                instrumentation code is executed. At that moment, the stack does not carry variables from other functions.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In order to see your locals with Scrutiny, you can temporarily make them static and volatile. Making them static
                                will put the variable outside of the stack, attributing them a fixed memory location that Scrutiny can inspect.
                                Making the variable volatile makes sure that the compiler does not optimize the variable out.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Consider the code example below.
                            </p>
                            <pre><code language="c++">
int my_func(int x) {
    int my_var = 0;
    if (x > 0){
        my_var = 1
    }
    my_var = do_something(my_var);
    return my_var;
}</code></pre>
                            <p>
                                First, it is impossible to know the value of <code class="language-c++">my_var</code> at any point in the code. 
                                Making the variable <code class="language-c++">static volatile</code> will let us see the value at the exit of the function only. 
                                We can look at intermediate values by inserting additional static variables
                            </p>

                            <pre><code language="c++">
int my_func(int x) {
    static volatile int my_var;  // Do not initialize here
    static volatile int debug_var; 
    my_var = 0; // Initialization is moved in a different statement to keep the behavior of a local variable.
    if (x > 0){
        my_var = 1
    } 
    debug_var = my_var; // Catch the value of my_var for Scrutiny
    my_var = do_something(my_var);
    return my_var;
}</code></pre>
                        <p>
                            As you can see, we now have a hook that let us know if <code class="language-c++">my_var</code> 
                            was 0 or 1 before calling <code class="language-c++">do_something()</code>. 
                            We can look at <code class="language-c++">my_var</code> with Scrutiny to get the output of <code class="language-c++">do_something()</code>, 
                            and <code class="language-c++">debug_var</code> to get the value of <code class="language-c++">my_var</code> after the condition. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another consideration is that the rate and the order at which these 2 variables are read is not guaranteed.
                            It strongly depends on your communication link and the number of variables that are being watched at the same time. 
                            To get a synchronized reading of the 2 variables, use the datalogging feature and make an embedded graph of them. 
                            Then  you will see, for each loop execution, the value of <code class="language-c++">my_var</code> and <code class="language-c++">debug_var</code>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One last thing. When making your variables static, be careful to avoid reentrant function; static variables
                            will change their behavior since each call will share the variable with the caller function. This is rarely
                            an issue, unless you have task that can interrupt another one and both of them are using the same piece of code.

                                Most features are handled by the Python server and the server can be launched using the 
                                Scrutiny <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr>. The CLI accepts a parameter 
                                <code class="language-bash">--loglevel</code> that can make it much more verbose.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The following line will launch a server with debug logging.
                                <code class="language-bash">scrutiny launch-server --config my_config.json --loglevel debug --logfile scrutiny.log</code>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Note that the <code class="language-bash">--loglevel</code> option works for every commands, 
                                including running the unit tests. Running a failing unittest with debug logging is a very effective way
                                to find a defect.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                When running unit tests, error messages are hidden by default to avoid causing confusion while 
                                running tests that are expected to return an error. The following line will run a specific test with 
                                debug logging
                                <br /> 
                                <code class="language-bash">python -m scrutiny runtest --module test.server.foo.bar.baz --loglevel debug</code>
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Notice how we did not use the <code class="language-bash">scrutiny</code> command to run the tests, but
                                <code class="language-bash">python -m scrutiny</code>.  That's because when you install scrutiny,
                                the unit tests are not installed with the release package. Unit tests are available only in a development environment
